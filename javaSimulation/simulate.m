function [states] = simulate(settings, simTimestep)
% Takes a settings struct, converts it into the Java objects needed to run the
% simulation. 

% This function then takes the output from the Java code and
% converts it into an array of structs, each struct holding the state of
% the satellite at that time.

% Input: simTimestep    period of time between two internal states of the
%                       simulation (in ms) - around 1000
